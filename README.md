## 📋 Project Overview  
This Power BI project provides comprehensive analytics and visualizations of a UK healthcare center's operational and financial metrics, focusing on patient health, satisfaction, and provider efficiency. It offers detailed insights into billing patterns, departmental performance, and medical service distribution across major UK cities, with a particular emphasis on data from key insurance providers such as **Aviva**, **Allianz**, and **AXA**. The dashboard tracks treatment costs, insurance coverage, and satisfaction scores, while also analyzing provider performance, Length of Stay, and patient outcomes. Interactive visualizations enable stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions to enhance operational efficiency and improve patient care.
